    <br>
    <h4 align="center">Ingridients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Carrots(shredded) - 8 cups</li>
        <li>Whole Milk -8 cups</li>
        <li>Sugar - 1 cup</li>
        <li>Cardamon - 1 teaspoon</li>
        <li>Vegetable Oil - 6 tablespoon</li>
        <li>Almonds(roasted) - 1/4 cups</li>
        <li>Pistachio nuts(dry-roasted) - 1/4 cups</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h4 align="center">Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine carrots, milk, and sugar in a 6- to 8-qt. Dutch oven; bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium; cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid has evaporated, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, use a mortar and pestle or a rolling pin to break open cardamom pods. Coarsely crush seeds, discarding the shells. (If using ground cardamom, skip this step.)</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a very large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook half of cardamom until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add carrot mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until thick and jammy, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Stir in remaining cardamom. Sprinkle with almonds and pistachios just before serving. (Chill in an airtight container up to 5 days; freeze up to 3 months.)</li>
